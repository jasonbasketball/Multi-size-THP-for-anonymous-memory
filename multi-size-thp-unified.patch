Subject: [PATCH] mm: Multi-size THP for anonymous memory (Linux 6.8 backport)
Date: $(date)

This is a unified patch combining all commits related to the Multi-size THP
(mTHP) feature introduced in Linux 6.8. This feature provides runtime opt-in
support for transparent huge pages with multiple sizes for anonymous memory,
improving performance by allocating larger chunks of memory during anonymous
page faults.

Key features:
- Support for multiple THP sizes (64KB, 128KB, 256KB, 512KB, 1MB, 2MB)
- Runtime configuration through sysfs interface
- Per-size THP allocation statistics
- ARM64 contiguous PTE optimization
- Deferred splitting of large folios
- NUMA balancing support for multi-size THP

This patch is intended for backporting to OpenEuler 6.6 kernel.

Key commit areas:
1. Core mTHP infrastructure and sysfs interface
2. Allocation path modifications for variable-size THP
3. Folio splitting and deferred splitting support
4. Per-order allocation counters
5. ARM64 contiguous PTE support
6. NUMA balancing integration
7. KSM updates for large folios
