Subject: [PATCH] Multi-size THP for anonymous memory (Linux 6.8) - unified backport patch for OLK-6.6

SUMMARY / INSTRUCTION HEADER (REQUIRED)

This file is a *unified patch placeholder* and MUST be generated (not hand-authored) by:

  1) Exporting *all upstream commits* that implement the FEATURED Linux 6.8 feature
     "Multi-size THP for anonymous memory" from the upstream repository:

         https://github.com/torvalds/linux

     using the upstream version range:

         v6.7..v6.8

     The exported patch series must include every commit that is part of the feature
     as merged for Linux v6.8 (including prerequisite/fixup commits that landed in
     the same merge window and are required for correctness).

  2) Comparing that upstream patch series against the OpenEuler kernel repository
     and target branch:

         OpenEuler kernel.git  branch: OLK-6.6

     (i.e., compare what OLK-6.6 already contains vs. what upstream v6.8 contains).

  3) Producing a single *unified* patch (this file) that reflects ONLY the missing
     commits and/or minimal deltas needed to bring OLK-6.6 up to the upstream v6.8
     implementation of "Multi-size THP for anonymous memory".

In other words: this file should ultimately be the *net-new changes* required on
OLK-6.6 for the feature, not a verbatim dump of upstream commits and not a
re-implementation.

Constraints:
  - Keep the existing explanatory sections and diff stub below as-is.
  - Do not remove the patch-like header format.
  - Update/maintain this file by regenerating it from upstream + deltas, not by
    editing the diff content by hand.

TODOs (MUST BE FILLED DURING GENERATION)

TODO(1): Exact upstream commit list included in this feature export
  - Provide the full list of upstream commits (hash + subject), in the exact order
    they are exported/applied.
  - Confirm each commit exists in torvalds/linux and is within v6.7..v6.8.

TODO(2): Commands used to generate the upstream patch series (git format-patch)
  - Example template (replace with exact commands used):
      git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
      cd linux
      git format-patch -o /tmp/ms-thp-anon v6.7..v6.8 -- <relevant paths>
  - If additional commits outside pathspec are required, document why.

TODO(3): Commands used to diff against OpenEuler OLK-6.6 (range-diff / cherry)
  - Provide exact commands and results snippets for:
      * git range-diff
      * git cherry (or equivalent)
  - Clearly indicate which commits are already present (or backported differently)
    and which are missing.

TODO(4): Conflict notes and required backports
  - Record any conflicts encountered when applying missing commits onto OLK-6.6.
  - List any additional prerequisite backports needed due to OLK-6.6 divergence.
  - Document deviations from upstream (if any) and rationale.

[EXPLANATION PLACEHOLDER - DO NOT REMOVE]

This patch is intended to unify the upstream "Multi-size THP for anonymous memory"
feature backport effort into a single file that can be applied to the OpenEuler
OLK-6.6 kernel branch.
